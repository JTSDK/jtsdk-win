# JTSDK Files
####Version: All
####Last Update: 27-NOV-2014

The files section for [JTSDK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtsdk/) is broken down by version or release numbers. Each major release, where package changes / updates have taken place, will see a new folder, for example ( v2.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.2.0 ) and so on.

Each package set is designed to work with a particular installer and set of build scripts. While there may be some crossover between the various elements, users should generally stick with the latest Win32 Installer to ensure all the applications build properly.
